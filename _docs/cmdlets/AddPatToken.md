## Syntax
```powershell
Add-AzureDevOpsPatToken
  [-FriendlyName <string>]
  [-UserName <string>]
  [-PatToken <string>]
```

## Description
Adds your PAT token to the windows credential manager and stores the tokens GUID, generated by the module, and its friendly name in the configuration repository.

The actual token is stored by Windows and the module uses a GUID it generates as it's way of retrieving that credential value from the operating system.

Additionally this value, and other pat tokens are not loaded in to memory by the module until you make the first call to the Azure Dev Ops Rest API.

## Example
```powershell
Add-AzureDevOpsPatToken -FriendlyName MainToken -UserName ExampleUser@contoso.com -PatToken "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
```
